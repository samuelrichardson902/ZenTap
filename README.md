ZenTap is an open-source Android app blocker that uses a physical NFC tag as a "key" to your distractions. By creating a real-world barrier, it helps you break the habit of impulsive app-opening and **doomscrolling**.

Unlike software-only blockers that are easy to bypass, ZenTap requires a deliberate, physical action. Place your tag in another room to create real friction, turning mindless impulse into a conscious choice.

## Why ZenTap is Different

ZenTap is built on a foundation of trust, privacy, and user choice.

- ### Physical Friction, Digital Focus

  We turn a digital problem into a physical solution. To unlock your apps, you must perform a deliberate actionâ€”like walking to the kitchen to tap your tag. This real-world friction breaks the habit loop and gives you back control.

- ### 100% Open-Source

  Our code is public on GitHub. This means complete transparency and the ability for you to inspect, modify, and even add features to your own app.

- ### Privacy-First & Offline

  ZenTap is 100% offline. All your data (blocked apps, schedules) is stored exclusively on your device. No servers, no tracking, no exceptions. Your data is yours, period.

- ### Free Forever. No Subscriptions.
  The ZenTap app is 100% free. It works with any standard NFC tag, removing the barrier to entry. You can follow our simple guide to program your own, or buy a pre-programmed tag from us to skip the setup and support the project.

## Key Features

- **NFC Tag Locking:** The core feature. Use a physical tag to lock and unlock your apps.
- **Strict Mode:** For unbreakable focus, this mode grants a short, pre-set unlock duration instead of disabling the block completely.
- **AutoLock:** Schedule ZenTap to automatically lock distracting apps during work, study, or evenings.
- **Break Glass:** A failsafe for true emergencies, with built-in friction to deter impulse usage.
- **Manage Multiple Tags:** Sync multiple tags to use at home, in the office, or on the go.
