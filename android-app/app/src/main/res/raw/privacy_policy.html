<h1>Privacy Policy for Zentap</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-09-12</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to Zentap. This Privacy Policy explains how we, Zentap (the developer), collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
    Zentap is designed to run entirely on your device. We do not collect or transmit any personal data to our servers. All data remains on your device. The app requires certain permissions to function correctly, which are explained below.
</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
    The permissions granted to Zentap are used solely for the app's core functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility Service:</strong> This permission is used to monitor which app is currently in the foreground. This allows Zentap to identify when a blocked app is opened and display the blocking screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong> This permission is used to get a list of all installed applications on your device. This list is displayed to you so you can select which apps to block.</li>
    <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps:</strong> This permission is used to show the blocking screen on top of other applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Alarms & Reminders:</strong> This permission is used to schedule automatic blocking sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
    All data, including the list of blocked apps and your settings, is stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences. This data is not accessible to other apps and is deleted when you uninstall Zentap.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
    We do not share any of your data with third parties.
</p>

<h2>6. US Export Laws Compliance</h2>
<p>
    Zentap does not use any non-standard encryption and is compliant with US export laws.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
